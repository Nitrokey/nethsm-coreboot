	help
	  Specify the size the DPR region needs to have. On at least Haswell,
	  the MRC does not have an input to specify the size of DPR, so this
	  field is only used to check if the programmed size is large enough.

config INTEL_TXT_BDR_VERSION
	int "BIOS Data Region version"
	range 2 6
	default 5 if TPM1
	default 6 if TPM2
	help
	  Specify the TXT heap BIOS Data Region version. Sometimes when using
	  an older Trusted Boot version, it may report unsupported BIOS Data
	  Region version and refuse to set up the measured launch environment.
	  Setting lower version may work around such issue. Allowed values
	  currently range from 2 to 6.

config INTEL_TXT_TEST_BIOS_ACM_CALLING_CODE
	bool "Test BIOS ACM calling code with NOP function"
	help
	  Run a NOP function of the BIOS ACM to check that the ACM calling code
	  is functioning properly. Use in pre-production environments only!

config INTEL_TXT_LOGGING
	bool "Enable verbose logging"
	help
	  Print more TXT related debug output.
	  Use in pre-production environments only!

	help
	  This is the size that will be programmed in TXT_SINIT_SIZE.
	  This needs to be at least the size of the SINIT ACM.
	  This is platform dependent. For instance on CPX this has
	  to be the ACM size + 64K.

config INTEL_TXT_HEAP_SIZE
	hex
	default 0xe0000
	help
	  This is the size that will be programmed in TXT_HEAP_SIZE.
	  This is platform dependent.
